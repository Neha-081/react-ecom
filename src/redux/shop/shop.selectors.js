//By wrapping this function is memoize, we're saying that whenever this function gets
//  called and receives collectionUrlParam, I want to memoize the return of this function
//   (in this case we return a selector). If this function gets called again with the same
//    collectionUrlParam, don't rerun this function because we'll return the same value as
//     last time, which we've memoized so just return the selector that's been stored.
